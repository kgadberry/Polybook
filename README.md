# Polybook
Polybook is [Polymer](https://modrinth.com/mod/polymer) mod that adds a craftable Knowledge Book item to the game that opens the Polydex menu. It was made to make the usage of [Polydex](https://modrinth.com/mod/polydex) more intuitive.

Right-click with the item to open Polydex menu, instead of using `/polydex`.
